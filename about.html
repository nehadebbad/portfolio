              <p>With the advent of smart phones to developments in artificial intelligence, the advancement of technology has been exponential.
                Ever since I was young, I was fascinated by emerging technologies and dedicated my time to understand the new concepts behind them.
                As my life has essentially coincided with the rise of the modern computing industry, I sense that there are still enormous developments to come in this field.
                The innovations that keep evolving hold infinite scope for innovation and logic.
                I have an appreciation for the breadth of this field and the nearly endless possibilities for further study.
                This motivated me to take Computer Science as my undergraduate major.</p>
              <p>During my undergraduate study, I was introduced to key computer science subjects like Database Management Systems, Data structures, Object Oriented Analysis and Design, Compiler Design, Operating Systems, Information Security, Software Testing Methodologies, Computer Networks and so on.
                Through my undergraduate program, I acquired an overall perspective of this scientific discipline, with a particular interest in Full-Stack Development. After taking a multitude of Computer Science courses over my academic career, I stood at the crossroads of my life where I had to choose between a career in the IT industry or to pursue further studies.
                Given the economic and technological liberalization taking place, I believe that I would be able to leverage my advanced knowledge and experience from MS Program to build a successful career in Computer Science.
                After carefully contemplating various career options open to me, I have decided to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science in a more competitive, esteemed and an international environment. </p>

              <p>While pursuing my Master's at University of North Carolina at Charlotte in Computer Science, I worked for Syntax, a leading managed cloud provider for mission-critical applications.
                My prior internship experience focused on application development in an Agile environment (scrum) where I had an opportunity to design Vue views and components,
                work on extending webpack to aggregate licenses from third party dependencies, create server-side endpoints, work on MariaDB,
                work on MySQL stored procedures and write unit tests using Nightwatch and Selenium.
                I also got an opportunity to closely work on optimizing the code efficiency of SLA reporting tool in C#.
                In the course of my internship, my passion towards this field increased immensely.
                I also worked on numerous personal projects that used technologies like Nodejs, MongoDB, PHP, Java.</p>
              <p>During my leisure time, I dabble in arts and writing.
                As the saying goes "A picture can paint a thousand words", painting not only refreshes my mind but it also helps me think in innovative ways and increases my concentration.
                My interest in writing paved way for me to take up an active role in the college magazine editorial board and also take up additional responsibilities in the college literary and art clubs.
                I believe that my interest in arts will reflect on my work making it even more creative.</p>
              <p>I am determined to accept new challenges and willing to dive deeper into the field of Software Development with a passion to learn and grow from my experiences. 
                My long-term goal is to find a right opportunity with a dedicated team to put my skills and knowledge to a good use. I would be happy to work in a positive environment that promotes a good learning experience.</p>
